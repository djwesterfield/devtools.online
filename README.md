> A massive online collection of web development tools, links & resources

DevTools is a massive online collection of tools, links, and resources for web designers and developers.  
I wanted to create an all-in-one list of all the tools I found useful. Now, instead of constantly searching  
for that link you bookmarked a few weeks ago, or trying to stay up-to-date with the latest web design trends,  
everything is kept in one easy to use location for you.  
   
   Though the site is now live at [www.devtools.online](https://www.devtools.online), the site is still very much in **BETA**. That means that  
   there will almost certainly be bugs and inconsistencies - I apologize for that in advance. If you happen to find  
   any bugs, or just have a suggestion on how the site could be better, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/thinkpixels/devtools.online/issues) for it.
   
   That being said, I've already started working on the **ALPHA** build, and with it comes some new features:  
   
   1. ~~Login with existing Twitter, Google, or GitHub accounts~~
   2. Toggle content between list mode and grid mode for a more detailed view of the tools
   3. Share counts will be displayed on each of the tools "Share" action buttons.
   4. Iclude the ability to sort the tools list by "Likes", "Date Added", or "Shares"
   5. Add a "Favorite" button to the tool actions, alongside the existing "Like" and "Share" buttons  
   6. With the ability to "Favorite" a tool also comes the ability to view a curated list of your favorite tools. Goodbye bookmarks!
   7. Image lazy loading to smooth the page loading process
 
There will be more features coming that haven't been listed here already, so be sure to star DevTools and keep an  
eye open for future changes. In the mean time, if you know of some tools or resources that other developers might  
find useful, and you want to see it added to DevTools, you can suggest there [here](https://github.com/thinkpixels/devtools.online/issues/8) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devtoolsonline).
